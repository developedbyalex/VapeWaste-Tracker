# VapeWaste Tracker

This is the VapeWaste Tracker, a real-time dashboard that tracks the environmental impact of disposable vapes. I built this project just because I got bored, but it highlights some real and pressing environmental concerns!

## Overview

The VapeWaste Tracker estimates several environmental metrics, including:
- **Vapes Thrown Away**
- **Vapes Sold**
- **Lithium Wasted** (measured in potential electric car batteries)
- **Potential Recycling Cost**
- **Fires Caused** by lithium-ion batteries in vape waste

All values are estimates based on real data from a BBC News article: ["The growing mountain of vape waste"](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66740556).

## How It Works

The dashboard updates in real-time from a chosen start date. These are the key metrics calculated:
- **Vapes Thrown Away:** 8.27 vapes are disposed of every second.
- **Vapes Sold:** 11.57 vapes are sold every second.
- **Lithium Wasted:** Every 1.75 hours, the amount of lithium in the discarded vapes could have powered an electric car.
- **Recycling Costs:** For every second, around Â£6.33 worth of recycling is added to potential costs.
- **Fires Caused:** Lithium batteries from vapes are responsible for one fire per day on average.

## Installation

To get the tracker running locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevelopedByAlex/vapewaste-tracker.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Data Source

The data used in this tracker comes from a [BBC News article](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-66740556) discussing the environmental impact of vape waste. The tracker calculates and updates based on the assumptions made in that article.

## Why I Made This

Honestly, I got bored and wanted to create something interesting, so here it is! It turned into a bit of a project highlighting the issues around disposable vapes and waste management.
